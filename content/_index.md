Hi, I'm Stuart. I'm a PhD student with [Di Cook](http://dicook.github.io/)
and [Matt Ritchie](http://www.wehi.edu.au/people/matthew-ritchie) at Monash
University. My main interests are in data visualisation, statistical computation, 
and genomics. Currently, my research focuses on _statistical graphics and computation 
for biological data_. This involves thinking about software tools and methods 
that will assist biological scientists in explaining their data and models. 

If you would like to chat feel free to contact me at
