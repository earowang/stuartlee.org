Hi, I'm Stuart. I'm a PhD student with [Di Cook](http://dicook.github.io/)
and [Matt Ritchie](http://www.wehi.edu.au/people/matthew-ritchie) at Monash
University. My main interests are in data visualisation, statistical computation, 
and genomics. Currently, my research focuses on _statistical graphics and computation 
for biological data_. This involves thinking about software tools and methods 
that will assist biological scientists in explaining their data and models. 

I enjoy using and developing R packages and I am passionate about making data
analysis more accessible to new comers. In my spare time I (very) occasionally 
write blog posts about stats or R. 

If you would like to chat feel free
to contact me at stuart(dot)lee1(dot)@monash.edu.
