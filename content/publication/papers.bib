  abstract = "Bioconductor is a widely used R-based platform for genomics, but
              its host of complex genomic data structures places a cognitive
              burden on the user. For most tasks, the GRanges object would
              suffice, but there are gaps in the API that prevent its general
              use. By recognizing that the GRanges class follows ``tidy'' data
              principles, we create a grammar of genomic data transformation,
              defining verbs for performing actions on and between genomic
              interval data and providing a way of performing common data
              analysis tasks through a coherent interface to existing
              Bioconductor infrastructure. We implement this grammar as a
              Bioconductor/R package called plyranges.",

              and selection in recombining pathogens",

              and Bahlo, Melanie",
  abstract = "Identification of genomic regions that are identical by descent
              (IBD) has proven useful for human genetic studies where analyses
              have led to the discovery of familial relatedness and
              fine-mapping of disease critical regions. Unfortunately however,
              IBD analyses have been underutilized in analysis of other
              organisms, including human pathogens. This is in part due to the
              lack of statistical methodologies for non-diploid genomes in
              addition to the added complexity of multiclonal infections. As
              such, we have developed an IBD methodology, called isoRelate, for
              analysis of haploid recombining microorganisms in the presence of
              multiclonal infections. Using the inferred IBD status at genomic
              locations, we have also developed a novel statistic for
              identifying loci under positive selection and propose relatedness
              networks as a means of exploring shared haplotypes within
              populations. We evaluate the performance of our methodologies for
              detecting IBD and selection, including comparisons with existing
              tools, then perform an exploratory analysis of whole genome
              sequencing data from a global Plasmodium falciparum dataset of
              more than 2500 genomes. This analysis identifies Southeast Asia
              as having many highly related isolates, possibly as a result of
              both reduced transmission from intensified control efforts and
              population bottlenecks following the emergence of antimalarial
              drug resistance. Many signals of selection are also identified,
              most of which overlap genes that are known to be associated with
              drug resistance, in addition to two novel signals observed in
              multiple countries that have yet to be explored in detail.
              Additionally, we investigate relatedness networks over the
              selected loci and determine that one of these sweeps has spread
              between continents while the other has arisen independently in
              different countries. IBD analysis of microorganisms using
              isoRelate can be used for exploring population structure,
              positive selection and haplotype distributions, and will be a
              valuable tool for monitoring disease control and elimination
              efforts of many diseases.",
