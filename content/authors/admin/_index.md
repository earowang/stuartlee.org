I am a PhD student at Monash University where I am supervised 
by [Dianne Cook](https://dicook.org/), [Paul Harrison](http://logarithmic.net/pfh/)
and [Matthew Ritchie (WEHI)](http://www.wehi.edu.au/people/matthew-ritchie).

My main research interests are statistical graphics and computation with an
emphasis on designing fluent interfaces for exploring high-dimensional data.
